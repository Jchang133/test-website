 <h2 align="center">blog 2 for the swing website(7/10/2024)</h2>
 <p>Welp... another blog I don't know where to even begin with this one (as it seems to be). But... I guess an update won't hurt.</p> 

<ol>
<li>
<p>
I was recently invited to a fast dance social, and I'm the sort of person who can go 180 bpm or higher before I can start sweating, but this was the most amount of fun I've had in months! Hopefully, more fast events are coming up so I can stretch out those muscles! 
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
I managed to go out of the country for a dance again! 
I was recently invited to dance in Shenzhen... Dancing in China was definitely a new experience, and learning a lot of new things was definitely on my list while I tried to find problems with my dance while dancing with a whole new set of people. But I may be a little bit too out of place. I didn't get a lot of dances there, but the ones I got really showed me the technicality I might need to improve further! 
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
I was also invited to a social of a rival swing club at the request of a friend. I won't name them because I don't wanna get sued, haha, but it did boost my confidence enough that at least I can do some things a little better than them and am willing to learn. Although I was not too fond of the whole rave environment that they had... The dances there did tell me to watch my connection too... because on the receiving end of one of my own powerful connections... I nearly felt like my arm got ripped off., which made me even more careful. 
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
I guess the last thing is the imposter syndrome... or that fear that something might happen... I want to take privates from Thom and Aurore myself... but it's almost like I can't because of the situation of no work to be found... I don't think I'll be winning the lottery anytime soon, so I guess I'll have to keep looking for jobs in this forsaken market until I find something... which is making it even harder to relax during dance... in addition to the whole social aspect of things. 
</p>

 <h2 align="center">well... first one. (17/9/2024)</h2>
 <p>Well... this is the first blog post I have here.</p>

 <p>To be honest, I don't know where to start. There is so much I want to say. But if you happen to find this blog, this is where I will be posting about anything regarding my dancing. Yes, that means the good, the bad, and the ugly. </p>
 
 <p>To be honest, I didn't even expect that as a dancer going on ten years, I would now be a mentor to the next generation. Or, as my friend Aurore puts it, I'm the lawyer (although I prefer thinking of myself as the insurance agent, haha). </p>
 
 <p>Lots of thoughts are racing through my head at the moment. I know from my psychological experience that this is mostly imposter syndrome. That these thoughts are meant to be ones that want me to stop... but I have people that are counting on me. </p>
 
 <p>Granted, I am already making some leeway as a tutor. I did manage to catch someone up to speed on a decently hard routine, and that moment when I realised I had taught all the right things gave me a rush of excitement that I never thought I would have. I'll try to keep going as much as I can. But I am at the bottom of a very steep learning curve. </p>
